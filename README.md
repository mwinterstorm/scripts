# scripts
Helpful scripts and tools for managing my servers

Probably not best practice as I am nothing more than an enthusiastic amatuer...

# Run
Run with 
```
sudo bash [scriptName].sh
```

# add to server
1. Add github if necessary:
```
sudo apt install gh
```
2. Then can clone in with:
```
gh repo clone mwinterstorm/scripts
```
